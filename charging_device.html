    <p></p>

    <h3>IMPORTANT:</h3>
    <p>To charge your DIRT watch, <i>only use</i> the included micro-USB cable and USB wall adapter. Please make sure you have charged your device for <b>at least 4 hours</b> before using it. 

    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        ⚠️ <strong>Warning:</strong> Whenever you are not participating in a study, please store your DIRT watch in a safe place, but do not leave it plugged into the charger or your computer as this may damage the battery.
    </div>

    <h3>How to charge:</h3>

    <p>To charge the DIRT watch, plug in the micro-usb charging cable to the watch and the USB-A to the wall adapter. If you have not done so, you will need to unplug the white data collection cable from the watch
        before you can plug in the charging cable.</p>

    <p>When the device is charging, you will see a red LED light turn on and remains lit while charging. Please ensure that
        the LED light is <b>solidly lit</b>. If you plug your watch in and the LED light is rapidly flashing
        as shown in the video below, then that means your device is <b>NOT</b> charging correctly. You will need to unplug the device and re-plug it back in
        until you see a SOLID red light. If you cannot get your device to charge correctly, please reach out to your panel management team immediately.</p>

    <p>When your DIRT watch is fully charged, you will see a green LED light turn on like the image below. This may take between 6-8 hours if your watch was completely out of battery. Typically,
        your watch should be usable after about 4 hours of charging. However, we recommend that you wait until your watch is fully charged prior to using it if you are experiencing any issues.

    <p>When you unplug a charged device, you will see a flashing red light similar to the video below. This flashing indicates that your watch is awake and has some amount of battery in it. 
        However, to know the actual battery level (how much battery you have), please connect your watch to the DIRT App.
