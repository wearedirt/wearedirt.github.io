    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        üí° <strong>Note:</strong> For best performance, please ensure your DIRT watch is always charged before using it. It is <b>very important</b> that your DIRT watch is charged otherwise certain functionalities
        will not work with our DIRT App! We recommend that you fully charge your watch prior to using it if you are experiencing any issues.
    </div>

    <h3>How to charge:</h3>

    <p>To charge the DIRT watch, plug in the micro-usb charging cable to the watch and the USB-A to the wall adapter. If you have not done so, you will need to unplug the white data collection cable from the watch
        before you can plug in the charging cable. When the device is charging, you will see a red LED light turn on like in the image below.</p>

    <p>When your DIRT watch is fully charged, you will see a green LED light turn on like the image below. This may take between 6-8 hours if your watch was completely out of battery. Typically,
        your watch should be usable after about 4 hours of charging. However, we recommend that you wait until your watch is fully charged prior to using it if you are experiencing any issues.

    <p>When you unplug a charged device, you will see a flashing red light similar to the video below. This flashing indicates that your watch has some amount of battery in it. 
        However, to know the actual battery level (how much battery you have), please use our DIRT App.
