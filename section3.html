    <p>The sections below will help you learn how to wear the DIRT watch and connect it to the provided data collection cable and sticky pads. You will need
        to do this everytime you want to participate in our research study.

    <h2 id="connect-cable" class="mt-5">Connecting the data collection cable</h2>
    <p>The data collection cable must be connected to the watch as illustrated
        below. Please note that on the cable, you will see a "B" on the plug end
        of the cable. The "B" side of the cable should face upward when plugging
        it into the watch as shown below (same side as the participant ID label
        on the watch).</p>
