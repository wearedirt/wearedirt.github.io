    <ol>
        <li>Wear the DIRT watch on your <b>left wrist</b> and tighten the strap to your comfort level. Please wear the
            watch comfortably - the strap should not feel too tight!</li>
        <br><img src="assets/procedure_1.jpg" alt="procedure_1" class="img-fluid rounded border" width="700px">
        <p></p>

        <li>Plug in the white data collection cable. Please note the "B" on the micro-usb plug should face up as shown
            below.</li>
        <br><img src="assets/procedure_2.jpg" alt="procedure_2" class="img-fluid rounded border" width="700px">

        <li>Take out the sticky pads from its packaging and place two stickies onto your fingers on your left hand as
            shown below (one pad on your index finger, one pad on your middle finger)</li>
