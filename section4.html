    <h2 id="charging" class="mt-5">Charging your DIRT watch</h1>
        <p>To charge your DIRT watch, please only use the included micro-usb cable and USB wall
            adapter.</p>
        <p>You should charge your DIRT watch <b>at least 4 hours before participating in a
                research study</b>. You will be given prior notice by your recruiter when a
            new research study will be released. Please use that information to determine when
            you should charge your device so you can participate successfully.</p>

        <p>When the device is charging, you will see a red LED light turn on like in the image
            below.</p>
        <div class="container my-7">

        <p>When your DIRT watch is fully charged, you will see a green LED light turn on. When
            this happens, the device is ready to use!</p>

        <h2 id="velcro" class="mt-5">Using the reusable velcro pads during data collection</h1>
            <p>When you have run out of the dispoable sticky pads, you can use the re-usable
                velcro pads before receiving more sticky pads from us. However, if you have
                slimmer fingers, the reusable pads must first be trimmed down to fit your
                fingers before using for the first time.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Preparing the velcro pads</h1>
                <p>In the images below, we illustrate how to cut down the velcro pads to size
                    when it is too big. In our example, we only needed to cut off a small piece
                    of the velcro from one side to make it fit. Once cut to size, the velcro pad
                    will fit snuggly onto your finger.</p>

                        anything behind it.In the image below, we illustrate that you should aim
                        to align the two red circles when putting on the reusable velcro pad.
